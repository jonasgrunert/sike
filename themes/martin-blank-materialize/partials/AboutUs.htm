<p>Sike is an all-in-one e-learning platform for students and long life learner. In January ‘16 we started to analyze the process students go through when they prepare for an exam and created tools to help them study with more efficiency. Every step of the learning cycle has its own difficulties starting with information management and ending with the thought “did I do enough?”. As of now we provide all information needed to start learning and we are able to simulate an exam with the actual literature needed to pass.  Which is amazing, students can get an idea how good they know their trade. Furthermore, we are currently working on a <a href="blog/1">blog</a>, which will feature the student life, science and interesting topics regarding our world. </p>
