<p>Tools that wait for coding are a student-to-student bookstore, an interactive forum for communication and discussions, a gamification feature and a credit system, which will be the heart of Sike. </p>
<p>
We, as Sike and a team believe that education and science should always be free. A student should not have to pay for her or his education. We believe that learning is a fundamental part of making everyday life better and therefore everyone should be able to study and follow their dreams through education! <br>
Yet effort, performance and a distinct service should always be paid, which is a predicament since education should be free.</p> 
<p>
We found a nice workaround and we are happy to introduce you to our credit system very soon. It will not only motivate the user to interact, it will also boost the economy and will finance Sike.</p>
